Hi, I’m Chris, also known as atipahy online! I’m passionate about cybersecurity and love exploring tech topics, from digital safety to everyday tips. My goal is to make cybersecurity accessible and relatable, helping everyone understand how to protect their digital lives. When I'm not diving into tech, you might find me working on fitness projects, coding, or finding new ways to inspire others to be their best selves.
